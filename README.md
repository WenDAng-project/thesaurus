### WRITE thesaurus

The **WRITE Thesaurus** is a carefully curated resource dedicated to Chinese cultural heritage, with a particular focus on contemporary arts and calligraphy. Developed by domain experts as part of the WenDAng project, this thesaurus, modelled in SKOS, provides a structured vocabulary that captures the evolving landscape of Chinese (contemporary) calligraphy and its role in redefining cultural identity.  
Designed as both a research tool for WRITE scholars and a comprehensive reference for a wider audience, the thesaurus categorises key concepts essential to understanding traditional and contemporary Chinese artistic expressions. By offering precise definitions and classifications, it serves as a bridge between traditions and emerging artistic practices in contemporary China.  

It is developed and maintained within the **WenDAng - WRITE Digital Archive project**.

### Structure

The WRITE thesaurus is modelled using **SKOS**.  
Each term is a `skos:Concept`, linked to a dedicated collection through `skos:member`, and to the thesaurus via `skos:inScheme`.

Each concept must include at least:  
- a `skos:prefLabel`  
- one or more `skos:altLabel`(s)  
- a `skos:definition` 

Semantic relations, external mappings and bibliographic references are recommended, but not mandatory.
